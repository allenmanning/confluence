Quarto includes a number of features aimed at making it easier to work with figures and subfigures, as well as for laying out panels that contain multiple figures, tables, or other content.

## Figure Basics

In Pandoc markdown, a figure is created whenever a captioned image appears by-itself in a paragraph. For example:

``` markdown
![Elephant](elephant.png)
```

![Elephant](elephant.png)

### Linked Figures

When rendering with Quarto, you can enclose a figure within a link and it will still be treated within output as a captioned figure. For example:

``` markdown
[![Elephant](elephant.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant)
```

[![Elephant](elephant.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant)

### Figure Alignment

Figures are center aligned by default. Add the `fig-align` attribute to the image to use a different alignment. For example:

``` markdown
![Elephant](elephant.png){fig-align="right"}
![Elephant](elephant.png){fig-align="left"}
```
<!-- TODO Better Preview for figure alignment -->
![Elephant](elephant.png){fig-align="right"}
<!-- // NOTE:  Must have carrige return or else this will be emitted as an Image and not a Captioned Image -->
![Elephant](elephant.png){fig-align="left"}

Note that figure captions are left aligned to accommodate longer caption text (which looks odd when center aligned).

### Alt Text

You can add alternative text to a figure by adding the `fig-alt` attribute to the image. For example, the following Markdown...

``` markdown
![](elephant.png){fig-alt="A drawing of an elephant."}
```

... will create the following CSF with the corresponding alt tag:

``` html
<ac:image ... ac:alt="example alt text">
    ...
</ac:image>
```

Note that the figure caption, and alt text can all be different. Also, confluence doesn't yet offer a way to set the title for an image.  For example, the following code...

``` markdown
![Elephant](elephant.png "Title: An elephant"){fig-alt="A drawing of an elephant."}
```

<!-- TODO Preview - remove title as it makes it seem like confluence supports it -->

![Elephant](elephant.png "Title: An elephant"){fig-alt="A drawing of an elephant."}


...produces this CSF:

``` html
<ac:image ... ac:alt="A drawing of an elephant.">
    <ri:attachment ri:filename="elephant.png" />
    <ac:caption>
        <p>Elephant</p>
    </ac:caption>
</ac:image>
```

### Multiformat Figures

[Bug #15 Multi-format Figures don't auto-append png extension.](https://github.com/allenmanning/confluence/issues/15){style="color:red"}

## Subfigures

If you have several figures that appear as a group, you can create a figure div to enclose them. For example:

``` markdown
::: {#fig-elephants layout-ncol=2}

![Surus](surus.png){#fig-surus}

![Hanno](hanno.png){#fig-hanno}

Famous Elephants
:::
```

Again, the last paragraph provides the main caption, and the individual figures carry the sub-captions. Here is what this looks like when rendered as CSF:

<!-- TODO Preview subfigures in a table -->

::: {#fig-elephants layout-ncol=2}

![Surus](surus.png){#fig-surus}

![Hanno](hanno.png){#fig-hanno}

Famous Elephants
:::

Note that the empty lines between the figures (and between the last figure and the caption) are required (it's what indicates that these images belong to their own paragraphs rather than being multiple images within the same paragraph).

Note also that we also used a `layout-ncol` attribute to specify a two-column layout. The next section delves more into customizing figure layouts.

## Figure Panels

Above we demonstrate laying out two side-by-side figures with subcaptions and a main caption. You may or may not want the caption / sub-caption treatment, and you might also want to use multiple rows of figures. All of these variations are possible.

To layout two figures with their own standalone captions (and no main caption), just eliminate the `#fig` identifiers and main caption at the bottom:

``` markdown
::: {layout-ncol=2}
![Surus](surus.png)

![Hanno](hanno.png)
:::
```

::: {layout-ncol=2}
![Surus](surus.png)

![Hanno](hanno.png)
:::


You can also eliminate the captions entirely:

``` markdown
::: {layout-ncol=2}
![](surus.png)

![](hanno.png)
:::
```

::: {layout-ncol=2}
![](surus.png)

![](hanno.png)
:::
