title: "Figures"
---

Quarto includes a number of features aimed at making it easier to work with figures and subfigures, as well as for laying out panels that contain multiple figures, tables, or other content.

## Figure Basics

In Pandoc markdown, a figure is created whenever a captioned image appears by-itself in a paragraph. For example:

``` markdown
![Elephant](elephant.png)
```

![Elephant](elephant.png)

### Linked Figures

When rendering with Quarto, you can enclose a figure within a link and it will still be treated within output as a captioned figure. For example:

``` markdown
[![Elephant](elephant.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant)
```
[![Elephant](elephant.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant)
