title: "Figures"
---

Quarto includes a number of features aimed at making it easier to work with figures and subfigures, as well as for laying out panels that contain multiple figures, tables, or other content.

## Figure Basics

In Pandoc markdown, a figure is created whenever a captioned image appears by-itself in a paragraph. For example:

``` markdown
![Elephant](elephant.png)
```

![Elephant](elephant.png)

[//]: # TODO Center Align()

<!-- ### Linked Figures

When rendering with Quarto, you can enclose a figure within a link and it will still be treated within output as a captioned figure. For example:

``` markdown
[![Elephant](elephant.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant)
```
[![Elephant](elephant.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant)

### Figure Alignment

Figures are center aligned by default. Add the `fig-align` attribute to the image to use a different alignment. For example:

``` markdown
![Elephant](elephant.png){fig-align="left"}
```

![Elephant](elephant.png){fig-align="left"}

Note that figure captions are left aligned to accommodate longer caption text (which looks odd when center aligned). -->
