title: "Figures"

Quarto includes a number of features aimed at making it easier to work with figures and subfigures, as well as for laying out panels that contain multiple figures, tables, or other content.

## Figure Basics

In Pandoc markdown, a figure is created whenever a captioned image appears by-itself in a paragraph. For example:

``` markdown
![Elephant](elephant.png)
```

![Elephant](elephant.png)
